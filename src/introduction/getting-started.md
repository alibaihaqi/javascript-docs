# Getting Started

You might need prepare some tools if you want to develop your project with JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
2. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It's my favourite text editor in general use cases since it's open source, and have many extensions (JavaScript/TypeScript, one of them)

::: tip Info
You might need install specific Node version to support some compatibility.
