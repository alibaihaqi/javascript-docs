You might need prepare some tools if you want to develop your project with Golang.

## Installation

Of course, if you want develop your golang project, you might need to install Golang to your computer / laptop. Please refer to [official Golang documentation](https://go.dev/doc/install) to detail installation process.

::: tip Info

## Developer Tools

You can use any text editor based on your preferences, or here is my suggestion:
1. [Goland by Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/): It's my favourite text editor for Golang since it's designed specifically for this programming language. You have to [subscribe](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/buy/#personal) if you want to use it.
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): It's my favourite text editor in general use cases since it's open source, and have many extensions (Golang, one of them)
